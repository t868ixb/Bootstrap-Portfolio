# Bootstrap-Portfolio

Bootcamp Homework 2 due September 12, 2018

This homework assignment was challenging.  My biggest struggle was balancing trying to figure out the proper layout (rows and columns), with incorporating the many many fancy bootstrap options -- of which I didn't understand the purpose of many.

At the end, I focused on setting the rows and the columns as best I could, and reused as much of the code from Homework 1.
